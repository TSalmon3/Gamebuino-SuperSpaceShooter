Proper enemy spawning.
Score.
More enemy types.
	- It would be nice to have a system where each enemy type's move and shoot sequences were stored in the ROM and the enemy class just read the relevant data and performed the relevant actions.
Make it pause-able.
Variable difficulty (bullet hell mode?).
	AND/OR:
Multiple 'pre-determined' levels (enemies are always in the same pattern in each specific level).
	-this could be achieved by using the same random seed each time a particular level is played.
Power-ups and abilities? e.g shield, more bullets in multiple directions, etc.
Better system for finding empty space in array for new enemies and bullets.
Music and sounds.
